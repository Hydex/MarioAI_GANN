# MarioAI_ANN
A simple project for my AI course, written in Java and using the MarioAI benchmark.

You can find my implementation of Neural Network and Genetic Algorithm.
With regards to the latter one crossover, mutation with random Gaussian distribution and crossover with random weights have been implemented

Can see the result here:

If more interested and want to have a description of the strategy and implementation see the report inside documentation folder.

I have used JRE 1.8, build with Eclipse in a Windows machine.
