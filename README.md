# MarioAI_ANN
A simple project for my AI course, written in Java and using the MarioAI benchmark.

You can find my implementation of Neural Network and Genetic Algorithm.
With regards to the latter one crossover, mutation with random Gaussian distribution and crossover with random weights have been implemented

Can see the result here:
